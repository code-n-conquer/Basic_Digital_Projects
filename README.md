# Basic Digital Design Projects

This repository contains various digital design projects that I have worked on, categorized into Combinational Circuits, Memory, and Sequential Circuits. Each project includes detailed explanations, design files, and simulation results.

## Project Categories

### 1. Combinational Circuits
These circuits perform operations based solely on the current inputs. Below are the projects included in this category:

- **Multiplexers**
- **Demultiplexers**
- **Encoders**
- **Decoders**
- **Priority Encoders**

### 2. Sequential Circuits and Memory
These circuits are dependent on both current inputs and previous states. The projects in this category include:

- **D Flip-Flop**
- **Decade Counter**
- **Sequence Detector**
- **Single Port RAM**
- **Dual Port RAM**
- **Half Wave Rectifier using ROM**
- **Sinc Function using ROM**

## Project Details

Each project folder contains the following:
- **Design Documentation:** Detailed description of the design approach and methodology.
- **Circuit Diagrams:** Schematics and diagrams used in the design.
- **Simulation Files:** Testbenches and simulation waveforms.
- **Results and Analysis:** Observations and conclusions based on the design and simulation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
